Cheat: Alice and Bob means answer is 1


You are playing the game of nim. There are 153 coins.\nAlice and Bob are player ONE and player TWO they take turns.
\\nEach player can take between 1 and (constant, 4) coins on their turn.
\n\nSo far:\n Player Alice take 7 coins.\n Player TWO take 7 coins. Player ONE take 7 coins.\n Player TWO take 7 coins. Player ONE take 7 coins.\n Player TWO take 7 coins. Player ONE take 7 coins.\n Player TWO take 7 coins. \nNow it's ONE's turn.

Scaling Laws
Setup:
Fix training data and scale up model size.

Question:
How does the generalization curve change with model size?

Does accuracy on unseen configurations improve?

Do larger models learn a "simpler function" that reflects the game's structure?

Sprague-Grundy theorem
In this variant of Nim, where players remove 1 to k coins from one pile per turn, the strategic complexity 
depends on the nim-sequence’s structure, influenced by k. When k is such that k + 1 is a prime number (e.g., 
k = 4, k + 1 = 5; k = 6, k + 1 = 7), the game’s state space exhibits properties that minimize small cyclic patterns. 
Prime numbers, having no divisors other than 1 and themselves, ensure that the modular structure (related to pile sizes 
and move options) lacks small repeating factors. This reduces "subcyclic behavior"—short, repetitive loops in the strategy 
that could trap the model in local patterns. Instead, the strategy becomes more uniform or has larger cycles, making it easier 
for the model to learn a generalizable policy or prediction function. Conversely, when k + 1 is composite (e.g., k = 3, 
k + 1 = 4; k = 5, k + 1 = 6), smaller divisors introduce short cycles, potentially hindering the model’s performance.
Thus, the higher accuracy for k = 4 and k = 6 stems from the prime nature of k + 1, which simplifies the game’s underlying 
structure in a way that aligns with the model’s learning capabilities, avoiding the pitfalls of small, complex subcycles.
